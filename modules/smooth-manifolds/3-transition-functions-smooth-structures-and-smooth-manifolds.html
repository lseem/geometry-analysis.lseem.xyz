<p>In this section we will define what it means for a topological manifold to have a smooth structure. This smooth structure allows us to define what it means for functions on the manifold to be smooth, i.e. $C^\infty$. In this way, we can arrive at a point where we can do analysis (and calculus) on a manifold.</p>
<p>It is worth taking five minutes here to see if you can solve this problem yourself. That is, for a topological manifold $X$, think about how you could define what it means for a function $f:X\to\R$ to be smooth.</p>
<p>Perhaps you came up with something like the following. A function $f:X\to\R$ is &ldquo;smooth&rdquo; if and only if for any chart $(U,\phi:U\to\R^n)$, the composition
    $$ f\circ\inv{\phi}:\phi(U)\subset\R^n\to X\to\R $$
is $C^\infty$. But in order for this to work, we need to check that this definition is independent of choice of chart $\phi$. Alas, life is not so easy:</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Consider the manifold $X=\R$, and take the two charts $(\R,\phi(x)=x^3)$ and $(\R,\psi(x)=x)$. Is the function $f(x)=x$ smooth? Well, according to $\psi$, our function $f$ is indeed &ldquo;smooth&rdquo;:
    $$ f\circ\inv{\psi}(x) = f(x) = x, $$
which is smooth. On the other hand, according to $\phi$, our function $f$ is <em>not</em> &ldquo;smooth&rdquo;:
    $$ f\circ\inv{\phi}(x) = f(x^{1/3}) = x^{1/3}. $$</p>
<p>Thus it seems that $\phi$ and $\psi$ give rise to different smooth structures. That is, $\phi$ and $\psi$ are not <em>compatible</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Def:</strong> Two overlapping charts $(U,\phi)$ and $(V,\psi)$ on a topological
$n$-manifold $X$ are <em>compatible</em> if and only if the composition
    $$ \phi\circ\inv{\psi} : \psi(U\cap V)\to\phi(U\cap V) $$
is a diffeomorphism of subsets of $\R^n$. We call the above composition a <em>transition function</em>. As a matter of convention, if the charts don&rsquo;t overlap then they are automatically compatible. Note that we actually have <em>two</em> transition functions; $\phi\circ\inv{\psi}$ and $\psi\circ\inv{\phi}$.</p>
<p>Indeed, in the example above, the transition functions are $x\mapsto x^{1/3}$ and $x\mapsto x^3$, which are not diffeomorphisms, so those charts are indeed not compatible.</p>
<p><img alt="Defining what it means for two charts to be compatible." src="/images/modules/smooth-manifolds/smooth-compatibility.svg" /></p>
<p>This leads naturally to the idea of a &ldquo;smooth atlas&rdquo;, rather than just a topological one.</p>
<p><strong>Def:</strong> A <em>smooth atlas</em> of a manifold is a collection of charts which cover the manifold, and which are (pairwise) compatible.</p>
<p>A smooth atlas is exactly what we mean by a <em>smooth structure</em>. Note that a smooth atlas and a topological atlas are not the same. In particular, there could be many smooth atlases for a given topological atlas.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> In the previous example, each of the two charts of $\R$ actually constitute non-compatible smooth atlases $(\R,x\mapsto x)$ and $(\R,x\mapsto x^3)$, and so are different smooth structures.</p>
<p><strong>Def:</strong> A <em>smooth manifold</em> is a topological manifold together with a choice of smooth atlas.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Consider $S^1$ as a subset of the complex plane $\C$. Then we can create a smooth atlas of two charts, viz.
    $$
    \begin{align*}
        &amp;\psi_1(e^{it}) = t &amp;\textrm{for }t\in(-\e,\pi+\e)\\
        &amp;\psi_2(e^{it}) = t &amp;\textrm{for }t\in(\pi-\e,2\pi+\e),
    \end{align*}
    $$
where $\e&gt;0$ is small (we need it less than $\pi/2$). Thus we have the transition function
    $$ \psi_2\circ\inv{\psi_1}(t) = \begin{cases}
            t+2\pi &amp;\textrm{for } t\in(-\e,e) \\
            t &amp;\textrm{for } t\in(\pi-\e,\pi+\e),
        \end{cases}$$
which is smooth. Thus we have a collection of charts which cover $S^1$, and which are compatible. Thus we have a smooth structure for $S^1$, and so $S^1$ with this atlas is a smooth manifold.</p>

<h2>Exercises</h2>
<ol>
<li>In this question we prove that $S^2$ is a smooth manifold by giving it a smooth atlas using stereographic projection. Indeed, consider $S^2=\cbracket{x\in\R^3 : \norm{x}^2 = 1}\subset\R^3$.<ol>
<li>Consider the <em>stereographic projection</em> map $\si_N:S^2-N\to\R^2$ from the north pole $N=(0,0,1)$ depicted in the below picture. Show that
    $$ \si_N(x,y,z) = \rbracket{\frac{x}{1-z},\frac{y}{1-z}}, $$
    and prove that $\si_N$ is a homeomorphism.
    <img alt="Stereographic projection from $S^2$ onto $\R^2$" src="/images/modules/smooth-manifolds/stereographic-projection.svg" /></li>
<li>Consider now the stereographic projection map $\si_S:S^2-S\to\R^2$from the <em>south</em> pole. Show that
    $$ \si_S(x,y,z) = \rbracket{-\frac{x}{1+z},-\frac{y}{1+z}}, $$
    and prove that $\si_S$ is a homeomorphism.</li>
<li>Calculate the transition map $\si_S\circ\inv{\si_N}$ (or $\si_N\circ\inv{\si_S}$), give the domain and codomain, and prove that it is a diffeomorphism.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>In this question we compute a natural chart for $S^2$, and show that it is compatible with the smooth atlas constructed above. Indeed, consider the chart $\phi:H\to\R^2$ on the top hemisphere
        $$H=\cbracket{(x,y,z)\in S^2 : z&gt;0}$$
        given by $\phi(x,y,z)=(x,y)$ (see the below image).<ol>
<li>Prove that $\phi$ is a homeomorphism onto its image, so that it is indeed a chart.</li>
<li>Calculate the transition map $\si_S\circ\inv{\phi}$ and show that it is a diffeomorphism on it&rsquo;s domain and image of definition.</li>
<li>Give a chart on another hemisphere (there are six in total) which overlaps with $H$ (there are only four with this property). Calculate the transition functions between this chart and $\phi$, and show that it is a diffeomorphism.
    <img alt="The &quot;spherical cap&quot; chart is probably the first chart you'd think of for $S^2$." src="/images/modules/smooth-manifolds/chart-on-sphere.svg" /></li>
